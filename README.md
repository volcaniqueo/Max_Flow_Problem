# Max_Flow_Problem
This project was my 4th Homework for the course CMPE 250 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
This project was about solving a maximum flow problem. Detailed story and the input/output formats can be found in the description file. Since there are several algorithms for maximum flow problem (Ford-Fulkerson, Push Relabel, Dinic's Algorithm), I have chosen Push Relabel in order to have the best efficiency for the given problem.
## To Run the Code
First compile using:
```javac CMPE250_HW4_volcaniqueo/src/*.java -d CMPE250_HW4_volcaniqueo/bin```

Then move onto bin:
```cd CMPE250_HW4_volcaniqueo/bin```

Finally run using arguments:
```java project4main <input_file> <output_file>```
